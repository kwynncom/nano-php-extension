commit note: v0.2, error handle, build instructions


OTHER CHANGES:

promoting package version to 0.2.0 or above.  It has earned that and more based on my usage, but we'll be modest for now.


CODE CHANGES:

if clock_gettime does not return 0 (non error), then return 0 as the time
	-- only did this in the main function.  I'd already done it in uptime()

Or more specifically return both s and ns as 0.
